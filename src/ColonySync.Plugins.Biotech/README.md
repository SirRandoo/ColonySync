# Biotech

Contains the compatibility code for "Biotech," a DLC for the game "RimWorld."

## Current Features

### Xenotypes

Xenotypes are a way of defining a new species, based on the standard human. This
greatly differs from Humanoid Alien Races (HAR) in that xenotypes are a way of
defining pawns with preset genes, while HAR is a way of defining completely 
separate species with their own unique set of xenotypes.

This plugin allows viewers to specify the xenotype of the pawn theyâ€™re purchasing.
