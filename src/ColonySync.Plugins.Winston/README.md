# Winston Waves

This project contains the compatibility code for the mod "Winston Waves," a mod
that adds a new storyteller called "Winston Waves." This storyteller periodically
spawns waves of raiders, which incrementally increase in lethality as the player
survives waves.

## Current Features

### Poll Integration

A feature of "Winston Waves" is providing a reward poll when the player completes
the wave. This plugin instead converts that reward poll into a ColonySync poll,
which viewers can use to pick the reward.
