    <ColonySync.Bootstrap.Info>The bootstrapper’s settings menu should not be accessible through RimWorld’s "options" menu. If you got here from there, you should restart your game as it means ColonySync didn’t fully load properly. If restarting your game didn’t fix the problem, post your log file in the mod’s Discord along with a message stating you’re seeing this menu.

    Why does ColonySync load differently than other mods?
    ColonySync uses native DLLs that RimWorld can’t properly load. As a result, ColonySync has to have its own mod loader, which also includes loading any addons for ColonySync.</ColonySync.Bootstrap.Info>
